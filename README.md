# NLP to determine trending topics in Machine Learning research
Using NLP on NIPS Research Papers to discover the trendiest topics in ML

Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade are analysed to discover the latest trends in machine learning. 

*The technique used here to handle large amounts of data can be applied to other text datasets as well.

Tools used in this code : **Pandas, Numpy and Sci-kitLearn

### Trend : Growth in ML research over the years

### For analysing trends : LDA _(Latent-Dirichlet-Allocation)

#### Trending topics in ML research found via LDA:
Topic no. 1:
networks learning neural stochastic optimal algorithms optimization fast linear recurrent<br />
Topic no. 2:
learning multi deep efficient models neural networks recognition robust feature<br />
Topic no. 3:
model neural using learning convex sparse networks active matching visual<br />
