Using NLP on NIPS Research Papers to discover the trendiest topics in ML

Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade are analysed to discover the latest trends in machine learning. 

*The technique used here to handle large amounts of data can be applied to other text datasets as well.

Tools used in this code : Pandas, Numpy and Sci-kitLearn

Trend : Growth in ML research over the years
